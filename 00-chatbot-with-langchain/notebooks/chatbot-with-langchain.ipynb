    "The code below is a very extense class to create a model that can be logged and registered on MLFlow. The goal of this class is to create a service that packs the whole chain shown above, as well as the connections to Galileo Observe and Protect, so that the user can be able to keep track of the usage of the deployed service, as well as to protect against misuse of the chain. To register the model in MLFlow, three methods are essential:\n",
    "* **log_model**: Class method to be called to actually deploy the model. It will receive all the relevant artifacts that need to be packed into the model, as well as the signature of the methods of the service to be called\n",
    "* **load_context**: Method responsible to load all the context (artifacts and relevant information) in the deployed model. In our scenario, we break this into several steps, to allow building all the components of our chain as well as the external connections:\n",
    "  * **load_config**: Load the configuration and the secrets from external files, including what kind of model should be deployed (OpenAI, Hugging Face or local model)\n",
    "  * Load environment variables\n",
    "  * **load_model**: Loads the model according to the given configuration. Value of property *model_source* on config.yaml sets whether the model is:\n",
    "    * **local**: Uses local llama2-7b model, loaded from S3 as an asset in AI Studio Project\n",
    "    * **hugging-face-local**: Downloads a deep-seek with 1.5B parameters and performs the inference locally\n",
    "    * **hugging-face-cloud**: Uses Hugging Face API to access a Mistral 7b model\n",
    "  * **load_vector_database**: Loads the given documents into the vector database\n",
    "  * **load_prompt**: Defines the default prompt that will be used by the chatbot\n",
    "  * **load_chain**: Builds the overall RAG chain\n",
    "  * **protect_chain**: Connects the chain to Galileo Protect\n",
    "  * Setup of Galileo Observe callback\n",
    "  * Setup of memory as empty\n",
    "* **predict** Method of the deployed model that is responds to the REST calls to the model. Our implemented service goes beyond merely performing a static RAG, it also allows the user to configure prompt and document base through calls to the service. This is provided by the following methods:\n",
    "  * **get_prompt**: Allows the user to get the current prompt template of the chain\n",
    "  * **set_prompt**: Allows the user to change the prompt template of the chain\n",
    "  * **add_pdf**: Allows the user to increment the knowledge base of the retrieval by adding new PDF documents into the Vector Database\n",
    "  * **reset_history**: Resets the history of previous conversations\n",
    "  * **inference**: Performs the actual inference with the built chain\n",
