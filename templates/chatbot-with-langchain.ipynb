    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architectural approach that can enhance the effectiveness of large language model (LLM) applications using customized data. In this example, we use LangChain, an orchestrator for language pipelines, to build an assistant capable of loading information from a web page and use it for answering user questions"
